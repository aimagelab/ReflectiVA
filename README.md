## Overview
Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are the natural extension of
large language models to handle multimodal inputs, combining text and image data. 
They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. 
However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. 
In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. 
Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (```ReflectiVA```), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge 
and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database, ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge 
while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed.

## Installation
To create the conda environment named reflectiva use the following instructions.
With this environment you have all the packages to run the code inside this repo. 
```
conda create -n reflectiva python==3.8.16
conda activate reflectiva
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model
You can access the official model weights for the [ReflectiVA model](https://huggingface.co/aimagelab/ReflectiVA) on ü§ó Hugging Face.

## Dataset
The official [training dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aimagelab/ReflectiVA-Data) can be accessed on ü§ó Hugging Face.

```
cd <data_local_path>
!pip install huggingface_hub

python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download(repo_id="aimagelab/ReflectiVA-Data", repo_type="dataset", local_dir="<data_local_path>")"
```
Please note that the JSON file includes only the relative paths to the images. To access the actual images, you‚Äôll need to download them from their original sources: [infoseek](https://github.com/open-vision-language/infoseek?tab=readme-ov-file#infoseek-images), [encycopedic](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/encyclopedic_vqa) and [llava](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA?tab=readme-ov-file#visual-instruction-tuning).  

#### Data Infoseek
You can use this [link](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/reflectiva/data_infoseek.zip) to download the evaluation data for Infoseek.

#### Data Encyclopedic-VQA
You can find the evaluation data for Encyclopedic-VQA at this [link](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/reflectiva/data_evqa.zip). Additionally, the images used for evaluation can be extracted from this [zip file](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/reflectiva/evqa_inference_images.zip).

## Training

Before starting the training of `ReflectiVA`, make sure to set up the environment and download the dataset to your local machine. Additionally, update the absolute paths in the functions starting with `fill_abs_path` to correctly point to the image locations in your configuration.
Once everything is set up, you can launch the training job using the following command:

```
cd ./ReflectivA
bash scripts/train_reflectiva.sh
```

## Knowledge Bases and Reproducibility
In our work two different main knowledge bases are utilized.
To enhance the reproducibility of our approach, we provide access to both the knowledge bases and the FAISS index built on them for the best configuration presented in the paper. Specifically, the embeddings are generated using the [EVA-CLIP](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/EVA-CLIP-8B) model.

For Infoseek, you can find the index and json file inside this [zip file](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/reflectiva/index/infoseek_EVA_text_summary.zip).
Similarly, the index and json file for Encyclopedic-VQA are available [here](https://ailb-web.ing.unimore.it/publicfiles/drive/reflectiva/index/evqa_EVA_image.zip).

## Inference
Before running the inference, unzip the data and modify the paths in the `.sh` files to align with your local cluster setup and the files downloaded in the previous step.

Inference code for Infoseek:
```bash
sbatch scripts/ReflectiVA_infoseek.sh
```

Inference code for Encyclopedic-VQA:
```bash
sbatch scripts/ReflectiVA_evqa.sh
```
